# Stardew Valley Utilities
Web-based interface with useful tools for pulling up reference info from Stardew Valley wiki (https://stardewvalleywiki.com/). Currently hosted using Google App Engine
See the website: https://umawebstuff.appspot.com

Currently only has item gifting tool (finding villagers who love/like/are neutral towards a specific item, or finding the items a specific villager loves/likes/is neutral towards). But I might add other things in the future!

Note: it might take a while to load the page the first time you visit it; sorry lol
